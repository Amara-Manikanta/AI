    "### What arean MCP Server is?\n",
    "- MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open-source standard for connecting AI applications to external systems.\n",
    "- Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect electronic devices, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI applications to external systems.\n",
    "- Enterprise chatbots can connect to multiple databases across an organization, empowering users to analyze data using chat.\n",
    "- Let an AI system safely access live data (APIs, databases, sensors)\n",
    "- Add custom tools (e.g. summarize PDFs, control IoT devices)\n",
    "- Let models store context or memory outside the model itself\n",
    "- Enforce permissions & safety between model and resources"

    "\n",
    "- **Developers**: MCP reduces development time and complexity when building, or integrating with, an AI application or agent.\n",
    "- **AI applications or agents**: MCP provides access to an ecosystem of data sources, tools and apps which will enhance capabilities and improve the end-user experience.\n",
    "- **End-users**: MCP results in more capable AI applications or agents which can access your data and take actions on your behalf when necessary."
