    "What is a Large Language Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- An LLM is a type of AI model that excels at understanding and generating human language. They are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to learn patterns, structure, and even nuance in language. These models typically consist of many millions of parameters.\n",
    "- Most LLMs nowadays are built on the Transformer architecture—a deep learning architecture based on the “Attention” algorithm, that has gained significant interest since the release of BERT from Google in 2018."
