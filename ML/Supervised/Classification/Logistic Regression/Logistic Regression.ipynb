    "# Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type:** Classification (binary or multiclass)\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Predict probability of belonging to a class\n",
    "- **Algorithm:** Models the log-odds of the probability as a linear function of input features\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(y=1|x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + ... + \\beta_n x_n)}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Output: Probability between 0 and 1\n",
    "- Threshold rule (default):  \n",
    "  - If \\( P â‰¥ 0.5 \\): predict class 1  \n",
    "  - If \\( P < 0.5 \\): predict class 0\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sigmoid Function\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maps real values to range (0, 1):\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Cross-Entropy (Log Loss):**\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  Loss = -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\Big[ y_i \\log(\\hat{p}_i) + (1-y_i)\\log(1-\\hat{p}_i) \\Big]\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intercept (\\( \\beta_0 \\))**: log-odds when all inputs are 0\n",
    "- **Coefficients (\\( \\beta_i \\))**: impact of each feature on the log-odds\n",

    "## Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric       | Description                                 |\n",
    "|--------------|---------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Accuracy     | % correctly predicted labels                |\n",
    "| Precision    | % positive predictions that are correct     |\n",
    "| Recall       | % actual positives identified correctly     |\n",
    "| F1-score     | Harmonic mean of precision & recall         |\n",
    "| ROC-AUC      | Discrimination ability of the classifier    |\n",
    "| Confusion Matrix | Table with TP, FP, TN, FN              |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- The relationship between features and the log-odds is linear\n",
    "- No or little multicollinearity between features\n",
    "- Independent observations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros and Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Interpretable, simple to implement\n",
    "- Provides probabilities, not just labels\n",
    "- Fast to train and use\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Assumes linearity in log-odds\n",
    "- Can struggle with complex or highly non-linear boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing  \n",
    "2. Splitting Data (Train/Test)  \n",
    "3. Fitting Logistic Regression Model  \n",
    "4. Evaluating Performance (metrics above)  \n",
    "5. Predicting New Labels/Probabilities\n",
