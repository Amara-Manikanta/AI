    "# Regression Model Metrics: Detailed Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Cost Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The **cost function** measures model performance by quantifying the difference between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Guides the model to minimize error during training.\n",
    "- **Common Cost Function in Regression**:  \n",
    "  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    Where \\( y_i \\) is the actual value, \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted value, and \\( n \\) is the number of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. R-squared (R²) – Coefficient of Determination\n",
    "\n",
    "**R²** tells how much of the variation in the target variable is captured by the model’s features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Range**: 0 to 1 (higher = better fit)\n",
    "- **Interpretation**:  \n",
    "  - 0 = Model explains none of the variance.\n",
    "  - 1 = Model explains all the variance.\n",
    "- **Formula**:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SSR}{TSS}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  Where SSR = Sum of Squared Residuals, TSS = Total Sum of Squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Adjusted R-squared\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adjusted R²** corrects R-squared for the number of features used in the model, penalizing unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Adding more features *always* increases R², even if they’re not useful. Adjusted R² will decrease if new features don’t actually improve the model.\n",
    "- **Formula**:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\overline{R}^2 = 1 - \\frac{(1 - R^2) \\times (n - 1)}{n - k - 1}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  Where \\( n \\) = number of observations, \\( k \\) = number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Other Important Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "Average of absolute differences between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "MAE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum |y_i - \\hat{y}_i|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "Average of squared differences.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "Square root of MSE, giving interpretability in original units:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "RMSE = \\sqrt{MSE}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Residuals\n",
    "The difference between observed and predicted values for each data point:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Residual = y_i - \\hat{y}_i\n",
    "$$\n",
