    "# Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way of structuring context-free grammars in formal language theory. A context-free grammar is said to be in Chomsky Normal Form if all of its production rules are of one of the following two forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A → BC**: A non-terminal symbol (A) produces exactly two non-terminal symbols (B and C).\n",
    "2. **A → a**: A non-terminal symbol (A) produces exactly one terminal symbol (a).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the grammar may include the rule **S → ε**, where **S** is the start symbol and **ε** represents the empty string, but only if the empty string is in the language generated by the grammar.\n",

    "## Key Characteristics of Chomsky Normal Form\n",

    "- **Binary Productions**: All productions that generate non-terminals are binary (i.e., they produce exactly two non-terminals).\n",
    "- **Terminal Productions**: Productions that generate terminals produce exactly one terminal symbol.\n",
    "- **No ε-Productions (except for the start symbol)**: The grammar cannot have rules like **A → ε** unless **A** is the start symbol and the empty string is part of the language.\n",
    "- **No Unit Productions**: There are no rules of the form **A → B**, where both **A** and **B** are non-terminals.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Why Chomsky Normal Form?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplifies Parsing**: CNF is used in algorithms like the CYK (Cocke-Younger-Kasami) parsing algorithm, which can parse any context-free language in polynomial time.\n",
    "- **Theoretical Analysis**: CNF simplifies the theoretical analysis of context-free grammars, making it easier to prove properties about them.\n",
