    "\t-\tIf the beam width is 1, the algorithm behaves exactly like a Greedy Search (only taking the single best step at a time).\n",
    "\t-\tIf the beam width is infinite, it behaves like a standard BFS (exploring all possibilities).\n",
    "\t-\tBy setting  somewhere in between (e.g., 3, 5, or 10), beam search finds a middle ground: it explores more options than a greedy search to avoid dead ends, but fewer than BFS to save memory and time ."

    "- Imagine an AI trying to generate the next word in a sentence. Here is how beam search with a Beam Width () of 2 would handle it:\n",
    "\t1.\tInitialization: Start with the initial input (e.g., the word “The”).\n",
    "\t2.\tExpansion: The model predicts all possible next words (e.g., “The cat…”, “The dog…”, “The car…”, “The apple…”).\n",
    "\t3.\tEvaluation: It assigns a probability score to each phrase.\n",
    "\t4.\tSelection (The Pruning Step): instead of keeping all options, it keeps only the top  (2) mostly likely phrases:\n",
    "        -\t“The cat” (Score: 0.9)\n",
    "        -\t“The dog” (Score: 0.8)\n",
    "        -\tDiscarded: “The car” (0.4), “The apple” (0.1), etc.\n",
    "\t5.\tIteration: It now expands only from the two survivors (“The cat” and “The dog”) to find the next word, scores those new combinations, and again keeps only the top 2 overall best paths ."

    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "-\tMemory Efficient: Unlike BFS, it does not store the entire search tree in memory. The memory usage is linear with respect to the maximum depth and beam width .\n",
    "-\tBetter than Greedy: It avoids the trap of picking a locally “best” option that leads to a bad outcome later (e.g., a sentence that starts well but ends nonsensically) .\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "-\tIncomplete: Because it prunes paths to save space, it might accidentally discard the path that eventually leads to the absolute best solution (the global optimum) .\n",
    "-\tNo Guarantee: It is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, just a “good enough” one."
