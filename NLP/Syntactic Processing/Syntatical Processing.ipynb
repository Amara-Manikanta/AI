    "### 2. Syntactic  Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Description**:\n",
    "- Syntactic processing focuses on the structure of sentences, ensuring that the arrangement of words follows the rules of grammar. \n",
    "- It involves analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence to check if it is syntactically valid.\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Key Tasks:\n",
    "1. **Parsing**:\n",
    "    - Analyzing sentences to identify their grammatical structure.\n",
    "    - It involves breaking down a sentence into its components, such as nouns, verbs, subjects, and objects, based on the rules of a given grammar (like Context-Free Grammar (CFG)).\n",
    "2. **Parse Tree**:\n",
    "    - A hierarchical tree structure that represents the syntactic structure of a sentence.\n",
    "3.  **Dependency Parsing**:\n",
    "    - Identifying dependencies between words in a sentence (e.g., subject-verb relationships).\n",
    "4. **Syntax Error Detection**:\n",
    "    - Identifying incorrect grammatical structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "    -   Sentence: \"He goes to park\"\n",
    "        -   Error: Missing \"the\" before \"park\" (should be \"the park\").\n",

    "# Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is POS Tagging?\n",
    "- POS tagging is the process of marking each word in a sentence with its corresponding **part of speech**, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. \n",
    "- It is a fundamental step in syntactic and semantic processing in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Parts of Speech\n",
    "- **Noun (NN):** Person, place, or thing (e.g., \"dog\", \"city\").\n",
    "- **Verb (VB):** Action or state (e.g., \"run\", \"is\").\n",
    "- **Adjective (JJ):** Describes a noun (e.g., \"blue\", \"fast\").\n",
    "- **Adverb (RB):** Describes a verb or adjective (e.g., \"quickly\", \"very\").\n",
    "- **Preposition (IN):** Links nouns to other words (e.g., \"on\", \"at\").\n",
    "- **Pronoun (PRP):** Replaces a noun (e.g., \"he\", \"it\").\n",
    "- **Conjunction (CC):** Connects words, phrases, or clauses (e.g., \"and\", \"but\").\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Techniques used for POS tagging:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lexicon-based**:\n",
    "- This method uses a predefined dictionary or lexicon that maps words to their parts of speech.\n",
    "2. **Rule-based**:\n",
    "- This technique uses predefined linguistic rules to determine the part of speech for each word based on its context.\n",
    "3. **Probabilistic (or stochastic) techniques**:\n",
    "- These techniques use statistical models (like Hidden Markov Models or Conditional Random Fields) trained on annotated data to predict POS tags.\n",
    "4. **Deep learning techniques**:\n",
    "- This technique uses neural networks, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or Transformer-based models, for POS tagging.\n",
    "- It learns to assign tags based on large annotated corpora and contextual information.\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Applications of POS Tagging\n",
    "1. **Text Analysis:** Understanding sentence structure.\n",
    "2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying entities like names or dates.\n",
    "3. **Machine Translation:** Determining word usage in different languages.\n",
    "4. **Speech Recognition:** Understanding syntax for better output.\n",
